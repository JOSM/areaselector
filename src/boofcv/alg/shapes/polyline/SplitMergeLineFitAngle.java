/**
 * Base class for algorithm which employ a split and merge strategy to fitting a set of line segments onto an
 * ordered set of points.  The lines are an approximation of the original shape described by the point list.
 * This list can either be connected at the end (looped) or not, depending on the implementation.  The points
 * in the list are assumed to be ordered with each consecutive point connected to its neighbors.  The output is
 * a set of indexes which correspond to points in the original list that compose the line segments.  A minimum
 * of two indexes will be returned.
 *
 * The returned set of line segments is guaranteed to match the original set of points to within a use
 * specified tolerance.  That is, no point in the list will be more than 'tol' distance away from a line segment.
 * The split and merge technique works by finding searching for the point which is the greatest distance
 * from the two end points.  If that point is more than 'tol' away the line is split.  This is recursively repeated
 * for each segment until no more are needed.
 *
 * After the initial segmentation the points are split and merged until no more changes happens or the maximum
 * number of iterations has been reached.  Lines are merged if the acute angle between them is less than a tolerance.
 * Then the lines are checked to see if they need to be merged.
